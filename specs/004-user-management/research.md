# Research: User Management System

**Feature**: User Management System
**Date**: 2025-11-24

## Technology Stack

### Decision
Use the existing technology stack:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma, SQLite
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI
- **Authentication**: Existing JWT-based auth middleware

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Matches the rest of the application.
- **Speed**: No new learning curve or setup required.
- **Suitability**: The stack is well-suited for CRUD operations and RBAC.

### Alternatives Considered
- **None**: The project mandate is to use the existing stack.

## Unknowns Resolution
- **Language/Version**: Confirmed Node.js and React/TypeScript.
- **Dependencies**: Confirmed Express, Prisma, Vite, MUI.
- **Storage**: Confirmed SQLite via Prisma.
