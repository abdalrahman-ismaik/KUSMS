Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

**Constitution**: v1.0.0 (MVP-First Development - 3-week timeline)

## Development Philosophy (Constitution Principles)

1. **MVP-First**: Ship working features over perfect code. P1 stories only.
2. **Clean Code Over Documentation**: Self-documenting code, minimal comments.
3. **Working Software Over Testing**: Manual testing acceptable, automated tests optional.
4. **Speed Over Process**: Timeline takes precedence, document deviations.
