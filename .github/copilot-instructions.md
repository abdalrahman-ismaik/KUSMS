# KUSMS Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-11-24

**Constitution**: v1.0.0 (MVP-First Development - 3-week timeline)

## Development Philosophy (Constitution Principles)

1. **MVP-First**: Ship working features over perfect code. P1 stories only.
2. **Clean Code Over Documentation**: Self-documenting code, minimal comments.
3. **Working Software Over Testing**: Manual testing acceptable, automated tests optional.
4. **Speed Over Process**: Timeline takes precedence, document deviations.

## Active Technologies

- TypeScript 5.9.3 with React 19.2.0 (002-sidebar-navigation)

## Project Structure

```text
backend/
frontend/
tests/
```

## Commands

npm test; npm run lint

## Code Style

**Constitution Requirements**:
- Use descriptive names (self-documenting)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting
- Comments only for "why" decisions, not "what"
